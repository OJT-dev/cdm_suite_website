I have exported the frontend codebase of a reference project into 3 consolidated text files. I need you to update my CURRENT project to match this reference implementation.

1. **Dependencies**: Check my current `package.json` and install any missing packages from this list:
   `npm install lucide-react framer-motion clsx tailwind-merge date-fns react-hook-form zod @hookform/resolvers recharts react-hot-toast` (plus any others you identify in the imports).

2. **Code Integration**:
   - **Components** (`01_components.txt`): Compare with my `components/` directory. Create any missing components and overwrite existing ones to match the reference code exactly.
   - **Pages & Routes** (`02_app_pages.txt`): Update my `app/` directory. Pay special attention to the layout structure, `globals.css` styles, and page logic. 
   - **Utilities & Config** (`03_lib_config.txt`): Update `lib/`, `hooks/`, and configuration files (especially `tailwind.config.ts` and `lib/utils.ts`). This is crucial for the design system to work.

3. **Strategy**:
   - **Preserve Backend**: Do NOT delete or overwrite my existing backend API routes (`app/api/`) unless the reference explicitly replaces them (the reference export is primarily frontend-focused).
   - **File Handling**: If a file exists in the reference, it should exist in my project. If I have extra files not in the reference, keep them unless they conflict.
   - **Design System**: Ensure the design tokens (colors, fonts) in `globals.css` and `tailwind.config.ts` are applied correctly so the visual identity matches.

4. **Goal**: My project should function and look exactly like the reference code provided in these text files.
