## FAQ Section (Organized by Categories)

### Category 1: About Working With Us

**Q: What makes CDM Suite different from other agencies?**
A: We're not a factory for cookie-cutter marketing plans. We see ourselves as an extension of your team. Our main differentiators are:
- An obsession with data (no guesswork)
- A commitment to custom strategies (your business is unique, your marketing should be too)
- Radical transparency - you'll get straight answers and a clear view of your results, always

**Q: What kind of businesses do you typically work with?**
A: We've worked with a wide range, from ambitious startups and local service businesses to established e-commerce brands. The common thread isn't industry or size, but a genuine desire to grow. If you're passionate about what you do and ready to invest in a smart digital strategy, we're likely a great fit.

**Q: How much of my time will this require?**
A: We know you're busy running your business. We handle the heavy lifting. Your main time commitment will be during the initial strategy sessions so we can deeply understand your brand. After that, we'll establish a streamlined communication rhythm (like a monthly check-in call and regular reports) that keeps you informed without overwhelming your schedule.

**Q: Who will I be working with?**
A: You'll have a dedicated point of contact, a strategist who will be your guide and partner throughout our engagement. Behind them is our full team of specialists—designers, developers, ad managers, and SEO experts—who will be brought in as needed to execute your strategy. We believe in a collaborative, team-based approach.

**Q: What if I already have an in-house marketing team?**
A: That's great! We love collaborating. We can act as a force multiplier for your existing team, bringing specialized expertise in areas like technical SEO, advanced ad management, or development that you might not have in-house. We can handle specific projects or manage entire channels to free up your team for other strategic initiatives.

---

### Category 2: Services & Process

**Q: How quickly will I see results?**
A: It depends on the service:
- **Paid Ads**: You can often see an impact within the first month as we test and optimize
- **SEO**: It's about building a long-term asset; it can take 3-6 months to see significant, sustainable movement in rankings
- We'll give you a realistic timeline for each service based on your specific situation

**Q: Do you offer one-off projects or only monthly retainers?**
A: We do both:
- **One-off projects**: Website creation, app development, and initial audits are typically one-off projects with fixed scope and price
- **Monthly retainers**: Ongoing growth services like SEO, social media, and ad management work best on a monthly retainer model to allow for continuous optimization and improvement

**Q: What does your communication and reporting look like?**
A: Clarity is key:
- Detailed monthly reports breaking down key metrics
- Highlights of accomplishments
- Outline of next month's focus
- Shared Slack channel or email for ongoing communication
- Regular check-in calls to ensure alignment on strategy

---

### Category 3: Investment & Contracts

**Q: How do I know if this will be worth the investment?**
A: Marketing is an investment, not a guaranteed return. However, we minimize risk by:
- Building every strategy around YOUR specific goals
- Establishing clear Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) from day one
- Whether that's generating leads, increasing sales, or boosting traffic
- Tracking everything and providing transparent reports
- You'll always know exactly how your investment is performing

**Q: Am I going to be locked into a long-term contract?**
A: No. We believe in earning your business every month:
- Ongoing services (Ad Management, SEO, Social Media) are typically month-to-month
- Larger projects (full website build) work on a project-based agreement
- We want you to stay with us because you're getting great results, not because you're tied to a contract

**Q: Do you guarantee results?**
A: We guarantee our commitment, our expertise, and our process. We guarantee that we will apply our best strategic thinking and data-driven tactics to your campaign. However, we cannot guarantee specific outcomes (like "#1 on Google" or "a 500% ROI") because there are too many external market factors we can't control. We focus on guaranteeing the quality of our work, which is the best way to drive toward those results.

**Q: What's the difference between your fees and my ad spend?**
A: This is a great clarifying question:
- **Our management fee**: What you pay us for our strategy, expertise, and time spent managing your campaigns
- **Your "ad spend"**: The separate budget that you pay directly to the ad platforms (like Google or Meta) to run your ads
- We'll help you determine the right ad spend budget for your goals, but it is always a separate cost from our fee

---

### Additional FAQs (Services Pages)

**Website Services:**

**Q: What about hosting and a domain name?**
A: Hosting and your domain name are separate from the design and build cost. Think of it like this: we build the house (your website), but you need to own the land (hosting) and the address (domain). We're happy to recommend the best providers and can even help you get set up.

**Q: Can I update the website myself after it's built?**
A: Absolutely! We build our sites on user-friendly platforms (like WordPress or Shopify) for this very reason. We'll give you a walkthrough so you feel comfortable making basic updates, like adding a blog post or changing text. For bigger changes, we're always here to help.

**Q: What do you need from me to get started?**
A: To kick things off, we'll need your logo, any brand guidelines you have (like colors and fonts), and the text and images for the pages. Don't have all that ready? No problem at all. We can help with content creation and branding as part of a larger project.

**Social Media Services:**

**Q: Who is responsible for the content?**
A: It's a partnership! For our Starter and Growth plans, we rely on you for the raw materials—your photos, videos, and industry insights. We then refine, polish, and turn them into great social media content. If you're looking for a more hands-off approach, our Pro plan includes full content strategy and creation, where our team handles everything from brainstorming to production.

**Q: Which social media platforms should my business be on?**
A: That's the million-dollar question! The answer is: it depends on where your customers hang out. We'll help you figure that out. A local bakery might thrive on Instagram and Facebook, while a B2B tech company might be better off on LinkedIn. We focus on impact, not just being everywhere.

**Q: Is the ad budget included in the package price?**
A: Just like with our ad management services, the social media package price covers our team's work creating and managing your content. The budget for running paid ads on these platforms is separate. We'll help you decide on a smart ad budget that aligns with your goals.

**Pricing Page:**

**Q: Is there a contract?**
A: No! All plans are month-to-month with no long-term commitment.

**Q: How long does it take to see results?**
A: SEO results take 3-6 months; PPC campaigns can show results within weeks.

**Q: Can I upgrade or downgrade anytime?**
A: Yes, you can change plans at any time to fit your needs.

**Services Page:**

**Q: Can I pick and choose services, or do I need a bundle?**
A: You have complete flexibility. While our bundles offer the best value and a cohesive strategy, we're happy to create a custom plan with only the individual services you need to start.

**Q: How do you determine what success looks like?**
A: Success is defined by YOUR goals. During our kickoff, we'll establish clear Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), whether that's lead generation, website traffic, sales revenue, or brand engagement, and track our progress against them.

**Q: What is the onboarding process like?**
A: It's a straightforward, collaborative process. We start with a deep-dive call to understand your brand and goals, followed by a strategy proposal. Once approved, we set up all necessary access and get to work, keeping you updated every step of the way.

**Q: Who will I be working with on my project?**
A: You'll have a dedicated point of contact, but you get the power of our entire team. This includes expert strategists, designers, developers, and copywriters who all collaborate to ensure your project's success.
